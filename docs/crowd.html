				#### Intorduciton and Motivation
				- Numerous crowdsourcing platforms were available to support research as well as commercial goals.
				- However, crowdsourcing was not widely adopted by researchers for generating, processing or analyzing research data.

				#### Research Questions
				- Under what circumstances is crowdsourcing a feasible, desirable, or useful tool for researchers?
				- Under what circumstances is crowdsourcing not suitable for research?

				#### Definition of _Crowdsourcing_ and scope of the problem
				- Efforts/Activities that engage large numbers of people over the **Web** to help collect and process data.
				- This is different from the small-team, apprenticeship-like interactions that are currently common in research settings.

				#### Study Design
				- To understand and analyze current research practices around delegation, quality control,
and data sharing and how crowdsourcing could fit in the picture.
				- Authors conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 18 researchers: whose backgrounds spanned a range
of academic disciplines like political science, astronomy, palaeontology, neurology, history, etc.

				Each interview lasted 1 to 2 hours with a sequence of quesiotns designed to understand their research process.
				- _"How much do you care about the quality versus the quantity of data?"_
				- _"Are there particular worries about having data seen by other scientists or people?"_

				#### Analysis
				Classified the audio excerpts into several iteratively-refined hierarchical codes and  explored the relationships amongst them.
				- __Data__: *properties of the raw data*
				- __Task__ : *Properties of the research task*
				- __Activity__ : *Aspects of the research task*
				- __Product__ : *Properties of what was produced*
				- __Style__ : *Properties of how research was conducted*

				#### Findings
				Identified the five types of uncertainties in research based on recurrent themes in the coded data, which seem to directly influence how feasible, desirable or useful researchers believed crowdsourcing to be as a research tool.

				#### "Uncertainty" !? What!?
				Means gaps in information needed for decision-making during the process of designing and executing a research project.
				-  It influenced how researchers chose strategies to address these challenges, and understood current crowdsourcing technologies' capacities to accommodate these considerations.

				#### I. Process Uncertainties
				The process of discovery can be highly uncertain, iterative, and often serendipitous.

            <textarea data-template>
				#### II. Data Uncertainties
				- Sharing raw data can sometimes be problematic due to its sensitive nature; 
				- Researchers to keep their project "private" and shared with only a small group of close colleagues.

				#### III. Knowledge Uncertainties
				The feasibility of crowdsourcing can depend on the type of knowledge the tasks require: minimal or in-depth knowledge.

				#### IV. Delegation Uncertainties
				- How confindent the researchs are in delegating the task to general public?
				- They may doubt if a crowdsourcing task would attract adequate participation.
				- *"Why would anyone want to record electroencephalogram patterns on the weekend?"*

				#### V. Quality Uncertainties
				- Researchers might waht to delegate the task to a machine rahter than a human.
				- Crowdsourcing may be undesirable to researchers who require absolute precision.
				- But other may prefer if they can accept th equality-tradeoffs for collecting massive amount of data quickly or data from  diverse sources.

				#### Duscission and Conclusion
				- Under the right conditions, crowdsourcing can be a valuable tool for streamlining research processes.
				- Depends on Feasibility, Desirability and Usefulness.

				#### Crowdsourcing as a research tool
				- Design better features for researcher-centric crowdsourcing platforms.
				- Provide reliable decision-making guidelines and tools for practitioners and policy makers.
